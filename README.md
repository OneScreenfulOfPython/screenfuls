Screenfuls
==========

Examples of useful code using just one screenful of Python

Background
----------

At PyConUK 2013, we were told that a screenful of code was the right size
for a Secondary School teacher to git nicely into one lesson plan. So
we were asked to produce whatever code we could -- ideally doing something
awesome -- in just one screenful of Python.

Instructions
------------

* Create a folder called MyAwesomeExample or whatever

* Include a README.txt which includes a useful description
  of what the example does / shows plus an indication of any
  platform-specific or version-specific stuff.

* Try to make the code platform- and version-agnostic, but feel
  free to showcase something specific if that makes sense. Some of
  the teachers will be limited as to target platform; others won't.

* Pure-stdlib solutions are definitely good, but there's no problem
  with pulling in external modules. If appropriate, include a pip
  requirements.txt

* Try to keep the root of your directory uncluttered: just the
  README.txt and the code itself plus any necessary media.
  Use a subdirectory for screenshots or further explanations.
  Keep it simple.

Remember
--------

These examples are intended to be used by teachers. Their
job is teaching, not delighting in the intracacies of Python
package dependencies, nor in understanding the argot of the
programmer's trade.

Keep it simple. If in doubt, err on the side of an Dummy's Guide.

Not Sure
--------

* Specify PEP8?
* Tests?
* Common modules?
