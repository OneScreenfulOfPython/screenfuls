Examples of useful code using just 15 lines of Python

Background
----------

At PyConUK 2013, we were told that 15 lines of code was the right size
for a Secondary School teacher to git nicely into one lesson plan. So
we were asked to produce whatever code we could -- ideally doing something
awesome -- in just 15 lines of Python.

Instructions
------------

* Create a folder called MyAwesomeExample or whatever

* Include a README.txt which includes a useful description
  of what the example does / shows plus an indication of any
  platform-specific or version-specific stuff.

* Try to make the code platform- and version-agnostic, but feel
  free to showcase something specific if that makes sense. Some of
  the teachers will be limited as to target platform; others won't.

* If appropriate, include a pip requirements.txt

Remember
--------

These examples are intended to be used by teachers. Their
job is teaching, not delighting in the intracacies of Python
package dependencies, nor in understanding the argot of the
programmer's trade.

Keep it simple. If in doubt, err on the side of an Dummy's Guide.
